	<h2>Profile</h2>
  	<p>Hello, well that your reading this I guess you want to know a little about me<br>
	Personally working with computers is my passion, as I love everything to do with computers<br>
    Rhetorically I am well rounded around many things that are computer related, Just look at my Jobs and Projects!<br> 
	I all ways try to have a fun, and I am usually working on Projects or Homework, during my time<br>
	or thinking, about finding a solution to problems that occur in life, or will occur in my day.<br> 
	I am student at FGCU and during my free time I create web servers, program, Long board, and try to hang with my friends.<br>
	For life is too short and you only have one life (YOLO) so you might as well do the things you enjoy. </p>
    
    <h2>MY Passion/ Story with COMPUTERS</h2>
    <p>
	I love computers with a huge passion<br> 
	I have been working with computers since middle school,<br>
	the first time I really worked with one was when I took my  broken computer apart and put it back together.<br>
	<br>
	As I was in my soft-more year in high school, my parents bought a franchise called "I Love Kick Boxing" and I was going to set up their Computer network :)<br>
	To get the history on my knowledge of networks, while I was playing mine craft I wanted to host my own server. <br>
	So I created a server and opened a port and figured out the rest of the basic DHCP and DNS, on doing so led me to learn the world of networking routers.<br>
	I know there is a lot more then those two things, but this is not a learning session.<br>
	With this knowledge of networking,learning Networking from class, and getting my networking certification. At the same time.<br>
	I was able to set up all of the computers, and network them properly. With VOIP phones and a guest network, to separate the data flow.<br>
	
	<br>
	During my time in high school I was given the opportunity to get a lot of Certifications, and I got all the certifications I wanted.<br>
	Also I left the Computer Science Academy with the most certifications a student has ever achieved in that program.<br>
	<br>
	I was also the president of the computer club, and showed power points showing my fellow classmates on how the computer worked, <br>
	Not only did I give power points but my teacher had some spare parts of computers so i taught the members in the club how to put the computer together<br>
	and identified each part of the computer as they put it together and the function each part was made to do.<br>
	after we put the computer together, we formated the hard drive with the Digital divide program that was at my school.<br> 
	<br>
	My last two years of high school were the best as I worked for a local Computer repair business, called COMPUTER DESIGN and SERVICES as a Junior Technion <br>
	During that time I had the opportunity to deal with customers, learned how to deal with business, and manage their Servers and applications.<br>
	I also did repairs, and build computers in the store, and went to customers houses to perform repairs there. <br>
	<br>
	When I was leaving my High School, I got set up a server for the cyber-security program that was beginning to form in my school.<br>
	We connected the server to client computers, and set up Active Directory staging a working server.<br>
	Then we ran a honey pot on the server, and using the client computers we tested exploits in the honey pot<br>
	<br>
	Before College, I Interned, for the Summer at The school District for my school which was the second biggest in the state.<br>
	During that time I was able to meet some people that were really cool, and be on a team that went around the district<br>
	to repair and set up the computers before school started, as well as help out the IT people a each school and I got to help set up the computers in lab rooms.<br>
	<br>
	
	My first year in college I got a job for the Technion's that repaired the podiums for the professors, if something breaks or is not responding<br>
	and set up the audio equipment for events that occurred on campus<br>
	<br>
	Currently I am in College at Florida Gulf Coast University(FGCU) working towards my Bachelors for Software Engineering<br>
	After, I aim to get a masters in Computer Science as well, or get My A+ Certification.<br>
